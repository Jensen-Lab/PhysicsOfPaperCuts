# English description:
Paper cuts can lead to life-threatening microbial infections, but the physical processes that determine whether the skin is breached remain poorly understood. We used a robotic arm to determine if and when paper slices into an artificial finger made from ballistic gelatin. Our data indicate that lacerations are physically impossible for very thin and very thick paper. This may be of interest to chefs and surgeons (single-use knives) and children's book publishers (safety paper).
