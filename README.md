# THE PAPER CUT PARADOX: Explaining why thin paper does not cut
Paper cuts are a common injury that can cause significant pain and discomfort [1]. Surprisingly, the physics underpinning a thin flexible sheet of paper slicing into soft tissues remains unresolved. (Other cases, such as chess-wire cutters, have been described; e.g., [2].) In particular, the unpredictable occurrence of paper cuts, often restricted to a limited thickness range, has not been explained. Here, we visualized and quantified the motion, deformation, and stresses during paper cuts, uncovering a remarkably complex relationship between cutting, geometry, and material properties [3]. A model based on the hypothesis that competition between slicing and buckling controls the probability of initiating a paper cut was developed and successfully validated. 

This explains why paper with a specific thickness is most hazardous (≈65 μm, corresponding, e.g., to dot matrix paper or printed scientific journals). We developed the _Papermachete_, a cost-effective paper-based scalpel based on our results. It uses scrap paper blades and can easily cut into vegetables and meat.
