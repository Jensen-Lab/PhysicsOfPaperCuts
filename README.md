# THE PAPER CUT PARADOX: Explaining why thin paper does not cut
Paper cuts are a common injury that can cause significant pain and discomfort [1]. Surprisingly, the physics underpinning a thin flexible sheet of paper slicing into soft tissues remains unresolved. (Other cases, such as chess-wire cutters, have been described; e.g., [2].) In particular, the unpredictable occurrence of paper cuts, often restricted to a limited thickness range, has not been explained. Here, we visualized and quantified the motion, deformation, and stresses during paper cuts, uncovering a remarkably complex relationship between cutting, geometry, and material properties [3]. A model based on the hypothesis that competition between slicing and buckling controls the probability of initiating a paper cut was developed and successfully validated. 

This explains why paper with a specific thickness is most hazardous (≈65 μm, corresponding, e.g., to dot matrix paper or printed scientific journals). We developed the _Papermachete_, a cost-effective paper-based scalpel based on our results. It uses scrap paper blades and can easily cut into vegetables and meat.

# Summary
While paper cuts are typically a minor nuisance, they can lead to life-threatening microbial infections. The physical processes that determine whether paper cuts into the skin, however, remain poorly understood. To explore skin-paper interactions, we designed an experiment in which a piece of paper contacts an artificial finger made from ballistic gelatin. Our experiments indicate that lacerations are physically impossible for very thin and very thick paper, meaning a successful paper cut is only physically possible inside a relatively narrow range of thicknesses for a given angle. We design a paper-based scalpel based on the most cutting-efficient paper.

# Dansk resume
Selvom paper cuts typisk er et mindre irritationsmoment, kan de føre til livstruende infektioner. Alligevel står det ikke klart, hvad der er afgørende for, at papir kan skære i hud. Vi udforsker interaktionen mellem hud og papir eksperimentelt ved at forsøge at skære med papir i en finger-efterligning støbt i gelatine. Vores data indikerer, at det fysisk umuligt at skære hul med meget tyndt eller meget tykt paper. Det betyder, at det kun kan lade sig gøre at opnå paper cuts indenfor en relativt afgrænset papirtykkelse ved en given skæringsvinkel. På baggrund af det mest skærings-effektive papir har vi designet en papir-baseret skalpel.
